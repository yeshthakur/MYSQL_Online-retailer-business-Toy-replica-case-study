Online retailer business Toy replica case study using MYSQL Workbench
The online retailing business is quite famous currently. Here, you do not need to take orders by
going to each customer. In online retailing, a company launches its website to sell the items in
wholesale, and buyers can order the products that they require from that website only. In this
case study, you are introduced to a company that manufactures toy replicas or models.
Suppose the name of this company is Toylica.

Suppose Toylica has captured a huge market globally and supplies toy replicas in almost all the
countries. Wholesale buyers order products in their required quantity from the website only. As
the company captured a large customer base and enhanced its workforce, it is essential for this
company to maintain the database to navigate and store the employee-, customer- and
product-related information.

The brand has a separate department for analysing its sales and building a machine learning
model to predict future sales. Each customer’s order is saved into the database using the OLTP
process when they place their order. A team of data analysts and machine learning engineers
perform OLAP tasks on the historic data for creating marketing strategies to enhance the
business.

Suppose you are a data analyst working at this company. Here, you are only focusing on the
SQL queries to get an idea of the company’s sales.
